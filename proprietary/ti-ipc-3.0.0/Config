	TI-IPC package. 
	Inter-Processor Communication (IPC) provides a processor-agnostic API which 
	can be used for communication between processors in a multi-processor 
	environment (inter-core), communication to other threads on same processor 
	(inter-process), and communication to peripherals (inter-device). 
	The API supports message passing, streams, and linked lists.
